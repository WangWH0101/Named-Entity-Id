# Named Entity Identification
     Accurately identify the institution names, solving STM (Single to multiple) problems

# Problem Description
Many institutions have more than one names in public data. For example, *University of California Berkeley* has several names including 
*UC Berkeley*, *UCB* and *Univ of Calif Berkeley* etc. It's now very common that institution ranking based on their research output (e.g., publications) has been an important judgement standard (e.g., QS World University Rankings). As a result, named entity identification has become an essential step before any further related work.

# Method implemented in the study
