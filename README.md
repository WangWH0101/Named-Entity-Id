# Named Entity Identification
     Accurately identify the institution names, solving STM (Single to multiple) problems

# Problem Description

*UC Berkeley*, *UCB* and *Univ of Calif Berkeley* etc. It's now commonly used that institution ranking based on their research output (e.g., publications) has been an important judgement standard (e.g., QS ranking)
